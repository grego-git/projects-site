        "description": "My entry for the <a href='https://itch.io/jam/bigmode-2023'>Bigmode Game Jame 2023</a>. Entrants had <b>19 days to make a game</b> centered around the theme of <b>MODE</b>, in which any interpretation of the word could be used within our game's concept.<br/><br/>I developed this <b>side-scroller action puzzle game</b>, where the player must clear out all enemies within each room, using a limited amount of sword slashes. The way I interpreted the theme was by having the player enter a \"mode\" at the beginning of each stage, in which time seems to have frozen, and they can freely move around without being attacked by enemies. Don’t be fooled though, enemies can still adjust their aim, and catch the player mid attack if they use certain moves twice in a row. At the end of each stage the player exits this “mode”, and all the attacks they executed occur consecutively, much like what you see in an action anime in which one character is on one end of the room, teleports to another end, and everyone in between is suddenly slashed by their sword. <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISgeGp7AF-8'>This video kinda spells it out</a>.<br/><br/>I placed <a href='https://itch.io/jam/bigmode-2023/rate/2423708'>#22</a> amongst 488 entires in the Originality category, with many people liking concept. One of the main critiques was the steep learning curve between levels, if I had time to go back and make changes I would definitely add some more levels in between the ones introducing new concepts so players can get more familiar.<br/><br/>The name comes from an inside joke...",

It's a traditional fighting game inspired by classic Capcom fighters (<i>Street Fighter, Marvel Vs Capcom, Rival Schools, etc.</i>).

Eventually I was able to develop my characters normals, specials, and grabs, and released this training mode like stage.<br/><br/>Although this game is still in development, I have <b>shifted development over from Unity to Godot</b>, since Unity attempted to enforce their new pricing model of 0.2 cents per download.
